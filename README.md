# Non-Contact Stress Trend Detection Using Webcam-Based HRV

## Project Overview
This project investigates whether a standard webcam can be used to estimate heart rate variability (HRV) trends associated with short-term physiological stress using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG).

The system extracts subtle color changes from facial skin regions to estimate heart rate, compute HRV metrics, and analyze relative stress trends under different conditions.

This project is designed for educational research purposes and does not provide medical diagnosis.

## Research Question
To what extent can webcam-based remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) be used to estimate heart rate variability trends associated with short-term stress under controlled conditions?

## Current Status
Project setup and background research phase.
